🎯 Goal: Become a Solana Blockchain Developer (6-Month Roadmap)
Prerequisites: Solid JavaScript/TypeScript, async/await, APIs, Git
Target Outcome: Be able to build, deploy, audit, and integrate Solana programs (smart contracts) with frontend dApps (React/Next.js)



📅 Month 1: Blockchain & Solana Fundamentals
📘 Learn Blockchain Basics

What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers.
Each "block" contains a list of transactions, and blocks are linked together in a "chain" in the order they were added. Once a block is added, its data can’t be altered — making it secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.
Think of it like a public, permanent notebook where everyone can see the pages, but no one can erase them.

Consensus (Proof of Stake vs Proof of Work)
A consensus mechanism helps blockchain nodes agree on which transactions are valid.
✅ Proof of Work (PoW):
Used by Bitcoin and older Ethereum versions.
Miners solve complex math problems to validate blocks.
Requires high energy and computation.
More secure but less eco-friendly.
✅ Proof of Stake (PoS):
Used by modern Ethereum.
Validators are chosen based on how many coins they "stake" (lock up).
Faster and energy-efficient.
Reduces the need for expensive hardware.
🟢 Summary:
PoW = High energy, secure, slow.
PoS = Low energy, scalable, eco-friendly.

Gas, transactions, blocks, mempool
Gas: The fee paid to perform actions (like sending ETH or running smart contracts). Think of it as "fuel" for your transaction.
Transactions: Actions made by users like sending tokens or interacting with contracts.
Blocks: Groups of validated transactions that are added to the blockchain.
Mempool: A waiting room where pending transactions wait to be picked by a miner/validator and added to a block.


Accounts vs contracts vs wallets
🧾 Accounts:
There are two types:
Externally Owned Accounts (EOA): Controlled by a private key (e.g., your wallet).
Contract Accounts: Run smart contract code and are controlled by logic.

📜 Contracts:
These are self-executing programs stored on the blockchain.
They define rules (e.g., for a token, game, or auction) and can’t be changed once deployed.

💼 Wallets:
Interfaces like MetaMask, Trust Wallet.
Help manage your EOA — store your private keys, send transactions, and interact with dApps.

🔷 Understand Solana Architecture
Solana vs Ethereum: Speed, cost, execution
🔁 Solana vs Ethereum: Speed, Cost, Execution
Feature	Solana	Ethereum
Speed	~65,000 transactions/sec (theoretical), 1000s real-time	~30 TPS (Ethereum mainnet)
Transaction Cost	Very low (~$0.00025 per tx)	Higher gas fees (~$0.10 – $100+, depending on congestion)
Execution	Parallel execution using a runtime called Sealevel	Sequential execution in EVM
Consensus	Proof of History + Proof of Stake	Proof of Stake
Block Time	~400ms	~12s (Ethereum mainnet)

🔍 Key Takeaway:

Solana is faster and cheaper, making it ideal for high-frequency apps like DeFi, NFTs, and games.

Ethereum is more mature, secure, and has broader adoption but is slower and costlier.


What is a Program (Solana smart contract)?

Accounts model (stateless programs, stateful accounts)

Rent, PDA (Program Derived Addresses), CPI (Cross-Program Invokes)
